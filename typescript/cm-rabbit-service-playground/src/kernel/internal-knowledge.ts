4. 'Large Action Model' (LAM) is a new class of foundation models designed to make AI systems see and act on the Web and in the physical world in the same ways we humans do. Just as a large language models (LLM) aims to understand language, an LAM aims to understand actions, from the perspectives of why, through which, and how. It attempts to solve the three challenges current systems have:
  4.1. Intention. Human intentions are deeply personal, have layers, may be incomplete, and could change on a whim. Intention empowers LAM to translate natural language requests into actionable steps and responses that the operating system could leverage in real time. 
  4.2. Interface. As opposed to application programming interfaces (APIs), LAM understands and operates human-oriented interfaces across all kinds of desktop and mobile environments. 
  4.3. Interaction. Not only does LAM know how to interact with applications to achieve an objective, it also learns to achieve the objective in a humane way. Through Interaction, LAM will be put on a guardrail to produce behaviors that are safe, efficient, and indistinguishable from human behavior, making them a comfortable choice to delegate your interactions to.
5. rabbit is working on a dedicated and affordable mobile consumer hardware to host the OS.
